# Demo Node App
This is a demo application which hosts a simple web server which hosts a single page.

-----
### Testing
There is a flag in demoFuncs called PASS_TEST; when this flag is set to false then it is reflected on the page returned 
by the web server, it will also cause the only test in the system to fail. This can be used to test a CI/CD Pipeline.
